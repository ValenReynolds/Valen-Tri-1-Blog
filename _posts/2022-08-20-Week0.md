# Week 0 Hacks
Part 1 - FastpagesProvide a comment on this page to show Fastpages/GH Pages Web Server and Tool success [Fastpages](https://valenreynolds.github.io/Valen-Tri-1-Blog/)

Hint. Make a simple comment “Working on it”. This can be edited by clicking on Time Stamp of post; at this point you will see triple dots (…); clicking dots provides an Edit option; clicking Edit takes you to a friendly “Markdown editor”. Enjoy this editor, my suggestion is build your entire message in thi editor and/or build personal message in Fastpages / GitHub pages “_post” and share the following.

Share link to personal Fastpages / GitHub pages running on github.io. My suggestion is to change index.html to show it is really yours.

Share link to a new page (_posts) in your Fastpages project show use of Markdown and/or HTML fragments. You will need to learn special date requirements of a file as well as a little Markdown or HTML.
